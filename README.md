## 🌟 The Vision
**EasyTutor** is not just an AI wrapper; it is a **multi-portal academic operating system**. 
Built on a "Universal Professor" architecture, it detects whether a user is a **Kenyan High Schooler** (KICD syllabus), a **University Undergraduate** (Rigified Degree paths), or a **Self-Directed Learner** (Socratic Goal-driven), and dynamically re-architects its UI, system prompts, and curriculum generation logic to match.

## 🏛️ System Architecture: The "Professor" Model

EasyTutor uses a tiered redirection and orchestration strategy:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Sign-in] --> B{Onboarding Complete?}
    B -- No --> C[Multi-Card Selection Screen]
    B -- Yes --> D{Learning Mode?}
    
    C --> D
    
    D -- High School --> E[Portal: KICD Syllabus Explorer]
    D -- University --> F[Portal: Faculty Degree Browser]
    D -- Self-Directed --> G[Portal: Goal-Driven Mission Control]
    
    E --> H[Syllabus-Aligned Roadmaps]
    F --> I[Degree-Level AI Modules]
    G --> J[Socratic Study Paths]
    
    H & I & J --> K[Zod-Validated JSON AI API]
    K --> L[Shared Study Engine]
    L --> M[Cloud-Synced Progress Dashboard]
```

## 🚀 Key Portal Features

### 🇰🇪 **Portal 1: High School (KICD-Aligned)**
- **Curriculum Native**: Pre-seeded with 12 Core KCSE subjects from Mathematics to Computer Studies.
- **Form-Level Content**: Topics are categorized by Form 1–4 to ensure exam-readiness.
- **KICD Context**: AI prompts are culturally and academically tuned for the Kenyan secondary system.

### 🎓 **Portal 2: University (Academic Rigor)**
- **Scholarly Depth**: Subjects include Medicine, Mechanical Engineering, Law, and Architecture.
- **Degree-Level AI**: System prompts shift from basic explanations to undergraduate-level academic logic.
- **Integrated Exams**: challenging 15-question simulators designed for degree mastery.

### 🧭 **Portal 3: Self-Directed (Explorer Mode)**
- **Goal Mission Control**: Enter any learning goal (e.g., "Build a React-Native bridge") and get an instant architected roadmap.
- **Socratic Guidance**: The AI focuses on questioning and deepening understanding rather than just lecturing.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack (EasyTutor v1.0)

- **Frontend**: **React Native v0.7x** with **Expo SDK 55**.
- **State Management**: **Zustand** with high-performance persistence using **AsyncStorage**.
- **Database Architecture**: **Supabase PostgreSQL** with strict Row-Level Security (RLS) for student data isolation.
- **AI Orchestration**: 
  - **Primary**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (via Anthropic SDK).
  - **Secondary**: Llama 3.1 8B (via Groq API) for high-speed fallback.
  - **Formatting**: **Zod Schemas** for 100% predictable AI JSON outputs.

## 📐 Engineering Innovations

### **1. AI Self-Healing & JSON Integrity**
To eliminate hallucinations, the app implements a **Strict Validation-Retry Loop**. If the AI yields a malformed 7-day roadmap, the system automatically detects the schema error (via Zod) and re-executes the request with refined instructions, ensuring UI stability.

### **2. Persona-Aware Prompt Injection**
Every request to the AI is dynamically prepended with a portal-specific system prompt. The API layer "knows" the user's learning level and injects instructions to adapt the tone, depth, and cultural references in milliseconds.

### **3. Reusable Educational Component Layer**
Built a specialized component library (`SubjectGrid`, `TopicList`, `QuizEngine`, `RoadmapView`) that shared between all portals, ensuring code-reuse while maintaining distinct visual branding for each learning level.
